Alright this is a web page that displays all the devices/ their value.
	It basically takes the DeviceList.json file and spits out the data.
	As of now it updates changes to DeviceList every second, however I will
	change it so that it only triggers on the devices callback.

	Start server with node index.js
	go to localhost port 1337
